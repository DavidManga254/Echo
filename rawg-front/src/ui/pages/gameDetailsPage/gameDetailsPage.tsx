                        Gather your party, and return to the Forgotten
                        Realms in a tale of fellowship and betrayal,
                        sacrifice and survival, and the lure of
                        absolute power. Mysterious abilities are
                        awakening inside you, drawn from a Mind Flayer
                        parasite planted in your brain. Resist, and
                        turn darkness against itself. Or embrace
                        corruption, and become ultimate evil. From the
                        creators of Divinity: Original Sin 2 comes a
                        next-generation RPG, set in the world of
                        Dungeons and Dragons. Choose from a wide
                        selection of D&D races and classes, or play as
                        an origin character with a hand-crafted
                        background. Adventure, loot, battle and
                        romance as you journey through the Forgotten
                        Realms and beyond. Play alone, and select your
                        companions carefully, or as a party of up to
                        four in multiplayer. Abducted, infected, lost.
                        You are turning into a monster, but as the
                        corruption inside you grows, so does your
                        power. That power may help you to survive, but
                        there will be a price to pay, and more than
                        any ability, the bonds of trust that you build
                        within your party could be your greatest
                        strength. Caught in a conflict between devils,
                        deities, and sinister otherworldly forces, you
                        will determine the fate of the Forgotten
                        Realms together. Forged with the new Divinity
                        4.0 engine, Baldurâ€™s Gate 3 gives you
                        unprecedented freedom to explore, experiment,
                        and interact with a world that reacts to your
                        choices. A grand, cinematic narrative brings
                        you closer to your characters than ever
                        before, as you venture through our biggest
                        world yet. The Forgotten Realms are a vast,
                        detailed and diverse world, and there are
                        secrets to be discovered all around you --
                        verticality is a vital part of exploration.
                        Sneak, dip, shove, climb, and jump as you
                        journey from the depths of the Underdark to
                        the glittering rooftops of the Upper City. How
                        you survive, and the mark you leave on the
                        world, is up to you.
